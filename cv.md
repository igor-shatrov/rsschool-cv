I want to become a web developer. I worked as a system administrator for 4 years. I served linux, windows servers, network. All this time I was learning something new. First on the network and servers, and now in web development.

I know html, css, js quite well. Studied and made test projects on react / redux. After that I learned php. Now I studied the laravel / vue bundle in mvc. I use github, docker, docker-compose, aws e2.

I learned video couses: "Практический JS", "React. Lite level".
